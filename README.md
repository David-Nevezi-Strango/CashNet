# CashNet. Simple Internet Banking app made for any platform

## How to install and run
To install the dependencies, enter into server and client folders and run `sudo make dependency`.
Then build the server using the command `make server`.
Both applications can be started using the CLI.

## Usage
- First, start the admin app, select the option of creating a new customer account, enter the credentials.
- Next, start the client app, log in, and you may select any option listed within the app.

- The admin app may also check all connected clients and may disconnect them. He may also connect a customer to another banking account so that it would become a shared one.
